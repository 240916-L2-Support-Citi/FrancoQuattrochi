Hello World
I don't like short poems. So why am I reviewing a haiku, you
may wonder? Well, I liked the title - 'Wife'. It went down hill
from there."
A world of dew,
And within every dewdrop,
A world of struggle.
The light of a candle
Is transferred to another candleâ€”
Spring twilight
Whispers in the breeze,
Leaves dance under autumn's glow,
Time drifts softly by.
Goodbye
